Scene Building Project is a Unity application designed as a testing and development tool for exploring and refining camera and user interface (UI) elements. This project serves as a foundational platform for evaluating various aspects of scene setup and interaction, and it is intended for use in future projects.
Features:

  - Camera Testing: The project includes a range of camera setups to test and optimize player perspectives. Users can experiment with different camera angles, positions, and movements to assess their impact on gameplay and user experience.
  - UI Elements: Various UI components are implemented to evaluate their functionality and integration within a scene. This includes testing different UI layouts, controls, and interactive elements to ensure they meet design and usability standards.
  - Scene Configuration: A variety of scene setups are available to test different environmental configurations. This includes experimenting with lighting, object placement, and environmental effects to understand how they influence the overall scene aesthetics and performance.
  - Interaction Testing: The project features interactive elements that allow users to test and refine how objects and UI components respond to user inputs. This includes testing functionality, responsiveness, and the overall user experience.
  - Prototyping Tools: Tools and assets are included to facilitate quick prototyping and iteration of new ideas. This helps in efficiently testing different concepts and incorporating feedback into future designs.
  Usage

The Scene Building Project is designed for developers and designers to test and iterate on scene setups, camera configurations, and UI designs. By providing a controlled environment to experiment with these elements, the project aids in the development of more polished and user-friendly interfaces for future Unity projects.

Future Development: 

The project is intended as a base for further development, with the potential for expanding features and integrating additional testing scenarios based on future needs and feedback.
